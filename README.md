## Features
NASA GIBS Explorer allows user to browse different types of imageries provided by NASA GIBS from iOS devices without needing to have any knowledge of the API. 
### Available Imageries Query
The list of available imageries are obtained directly from the GIBS server, therefore when new imagery is available the list is automatically updated. The legend information is also generated automatically when new imagery is available. 
### View Imageries on a 3D Globe
User can select two imagery layers (base and overlay) and view them on a 3D Globe. 
### Time Selection
User can also select imageries from any specific time within the past 30-days of the most recent imagery.
